This is a simple AioRTC based software that takes your current screen and audio buffer and sends them over the network via the WebRTC standard to 'cast' to another display. 

Features (will) include:
- Pin Authentication, with a PSK bypass for certain clients
( For instance, Students have to type in a PIN, while Teachers can auto connect)
- Optional Audio Redirection
- Ability to pause casting
- Windows, Mac and Linux clients (Python Script Bundled into Native Execution Format)
- Chrome Extension (Eventually, so it can be used on ChromeOs devices)
- Maybe a slideshow option for waiting for casting?
